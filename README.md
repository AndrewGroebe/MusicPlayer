# MusicPlayer
A "proof of concept" music player application written in Java, utilizing JavaFX for styling and libraries and JSON for data storage.

This is what the JSON storage of a song looks like:
```
  {
    "title": "Rock And Roll All Nite",
    "artist": "KISS",
    "duration": 169,
    "album": "Dressed To Kill",
    "genre": ROCK
  }
```
Relevant resources are found using this information (mp3 file found by concatenating .mp3 on to the title)
